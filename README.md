# AVH_Project

*This is my github site for the Global Scholars in Paris: Hands-On Consciousness program taking place during Summer 2022.*

My project focuses on a machine learning algorithm developed to predict auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in schizophrenia patients ([Fovet et. al 2022] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2021.08.024)).

I hope to learn how this algorithm works in order to recreate the between-subjects contribution map (Figure 2) and to cross-validate the decoder by testing it against a younger subset of the patient dataset.

Thank you to Dr. Philippe Domenech, Dr. Pierre Yger, and Dr. Renaud Jardri for guiding me throughout this process and to Dr. Alfredo Spagna and Conor Shatto for making this program possible!
